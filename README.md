table-anarchy
=============

Table Anarchy is a UserControl that uses JQuery to forcibly deconstruct a table's cells into individual DIVs. This gives you more freedom to structure the former table's data using CSS. As it exists now, the UserControl only reliably works with a simple Table structure, where there are no colspans or rowspans.
